## About

I build my personal website for introducing myself, my projects, and blogs to make the developers life for the better!

## Blogs
<img width="1680" alt="Blog" src="https://github.com/haseakito/website/assets/107556045/41aa527f-5716-4c9e-86fd-864f0e0e0772">

Use [microCMS](https://microcms.io/) to post and manage blogs. Blogs are all about technology focusing mainly on side projects and my personal life from time to time.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
